    <string name="AppHelp1">When viewing an AMP webpage (e.g., in Chrome), use <b>Share</b> action and select this app to open that webpage without AMP (using the default browser, not necessarily the same browser).</string>
    <string name="AppHelp2">This works best on a page that Google has converted to AMP on the fly from a <i>non-AMP host</i> (e.g., mobile.nytimes.com). <i>Hosted</i> AMP pages (e.g., amp.usatoday.com) cannot be directly converted to equivalent non-AMP pages.</string>
    <string name="Support"><b>Support</b>: If you encounter a case where this app does not work properly, instead of giving it a low rating, use <b>Help</b> to open an Issue and give us details (URL, browser, Android version, device) and we will do our best to fix it.</string>
    <string name="Privacy"><b>Privacy:</b> This app does not collect, store, or share any personal or browsing data, except for opening a no AMP page when you request it.</string>
