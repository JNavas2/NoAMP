    <string name="AppHelp"><b>Open AMP web page without AMP</b>\n\nWhen viewing a Google AMP web page in Chrome, use <b>Share</b> action and select this app to open that web page without Google AMP (using the default browser, not necessarily the same browser).\n\nThis works best on a page that Google has converted to AMP on the fly from a <i>non-AMP host</i> (e.g., mobile.nytimes.com, www.foxnews.com). <i>Hosted</i> AMP pages (e.g., amp.usatoday.com) cannot be directly converted to equivalent non-AMP pages.\n\n<b>Please</b>: If you encounter a case where this app does not work properly, instead of giving it a low rating, send us details (URL, browser, Android version, device) by Feedback, and we will do our best to fix it.\n\n<b>Disclaimers</b>: Use at your own risk.\nThis app is not affiliated with Google.</string>
